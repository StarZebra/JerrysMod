# JerrysMod
Mod of Jerry
(I advice to not use this mod until it has a config unless you want all features to be enabled at all times)

##(Woopsies accidentally deleted folder with source code and cant get it back rip bozo ðŸ’€)

This mod is not intended for public use by any means, hence why I dont make a official release of it. This mod is just for me to practice Java development and github whilst working with something I enjoy. I cannot however stop someone from compiling this mod themselves and using it, at that point it is out of my reach.

## Features

* Your name is now Jerry forever
* Shows amount of dungeon runs required below dungeon score in new dungeon RNG Meter
* Make sneaky creepers visible (Turn off patcher entity culling for esp to work)
* Highlight glass in crystal hollows (it has a keybind to toggle, its 'G' as default)
* Finds rats in your hub lobby

## Commands

/getspeed (ticks) 
How much mining speed you need for that tick in each gemstone. 
  
/getticks (mining speed)
What your ticks are for each gemstone with that mining speed
